Type Exemple 

Achievers (want to finds every hidden treasur of little thing, every HF)
Killer (just like to pvp / troll)
Explorer (Like to go around the map)
Socializers (Just like to hang around and speak with friend / unknown)


Explorer are balanced by killer as going throught the game mayb more difficult, even killer nb mean more rewarding exploration, too much mean no more exploration = not happy =D 

Killer in the other hand like to chase Achiever as they offer a good challenge and dont like to be killed (troll)

Explorer may balance this duality (less caring about killer, caus not regarding about scores or reput), just want to be able to explore without getting instant kill. 
killer hate explorer (?)
but achiever loves them cuz they may find awesome stuff/technics generally shared in the achiever community

Socializers auto regulate themself, as more they are, the more they talk, and vice versa. 
Dont like to be killed/interrupt, so much killers might regulate them
