## Problematics 
- Hyper Inflation. Monney in game is usually produce by killing monster or completed quests, which lead to an increasing amount of monney devaluating the cost of things (fish 10g to 10kg)
solutions :
-> find currency sinks (mecanics to take currency out of the world, burn) like death repair cost for equipment to a vendor (no one take back the value paid) but not enough if cost are too low (make cost high ? Become a strong tool a pilar mecanic of the game, encourage largs scale war )
-> use buy and sell prices of vendors. Npc give a small percentage of an item value when player try to sell it to them, diff between cost and gain is burn (take care of useless things likes rock that can be sell, and become a financial actor)
-> Consumables are used to reduce the total amount of monney (potions, ammos, drink and food) make your benefits potions a must have and u may have a great leverage of control
-> auction house fees, beside avoiding selling useless items, it reduce currency from economy in a neutral transaction between two player
-> Service, pay for fast travel (stones for tp), long travel (cost for flying between 2 point), transportation, sending letter, open up new slot bank
-> back to real world asset to link value, like bonds 
-> taxation systems (housing, lands guilds, guild license monthly)
-> cost of permanent upgrade (skills costs, double specialisation). limited by max level -> Premium endgame trainers. up a stats for 40k exp and gold (extra long farm)
